Description
-----------

Canary Tokens are outstanding objects that can beacon back when activated.  For example, you could create a Word document that calls back.  Or, in this example, a little snippet of HTML code that calls back whenever it is activated.

In this lab, we will be creating a callback document on ther servers. 

Getting Started
-----------

First, we will need to surf to http://canarytokens.org

![Start](/home/adhd/adhdproject.github.io/Tools/LiveCanary/Start.png  "Start")

Please select Microsoft Word Document fromt he dropdown.

Then, add a real email address in the email field.  This is so they can send you an email when the token is triggered.

Then, put in a message to yourself in the final box.

Please click Create my Canarytoken when finished.

This will give you the option to download the document:

![Download](/home/adhd/adhdproject.github.io/Tools/LiveCanary/DownloadDoc.png  "Download")

Please download the document.

Next we will want to email this document to a system running Microsoft Word:

![Email](/home/adhd/adhdproject.github.io/Tools/LiveCanary/SendEmail.png  "Email")

When you recive the email, please open it in Word.  The document is blank when you first open it.  However, you can rename it and add text if you would like.

Now, once the document is opened.  Go back to Canarytoken and manage the token.


![Manage](/home/adhd/adhdproject.github.io/Tools/LiveCanary/ManageThisToken.png  "Manage")

This will hten bring up the page that shows the document was opened, the IP and the location of the opening IP address.

![Hit](/home/adhd/adhdproject.github.io/Tools/LiveCanary/TokenHit.png  "Hit")

Now that you know the flow of creating tokens, please take a few moments and try creating and fireing other tokens.  In praticular try the PDF!
